The x3dom-full and x3dom.css files in this directory are included from the
OCC.Display.WebGL.js source code, and are required for rendering the examples
in the documentation pages.

If rebuilding the html examples, note that the source directory of x3dom-ful and x3dom.css needs to be changed to relative in the header.
